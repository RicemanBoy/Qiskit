First, however, let us implement the simplest possible version in which the function $f$ only has a single qubit input; this is also known as the Deutsch algorithm (without Josza).\n","\n","First, let us recap the Deutsch-Josza problem. There is a function $f:\\{0,1\\} \\to \\{0,1\\}$ and we want to know whether the function is constant, $f(0) = f(1)$, or if it is balanced, $f(0) \\neq f(1)$.\n","\n","Classically, you obviously need to call the function twice: once for $f(1)$, and once for $f(0)$. Then you compare the results, and see whether $f$ is indeed balanced or not. By now, you've seen that a quantum algorithm can get away with a single call to the function.\n","\n","## The Oracle function\n","\n","The main ingredient is the oracle function: a two-qubit gate $U_f$ which represents the function $f$.\n","\n","It implements it in a very specific way: if $q_0$ is the input qubit, then $U_f|q_0\\rangle|q_1\\rangle = |q_0\\rangle|(q_1 \\oplus f(q_0))\\rangle$, where $\\oplus$ is the bitwise addition\n","\n","As a warmup, you can implement the oracle. It depends on the `is_balanced` variable. If it is true, then $q_1$ should be constant, and, if not, it should vary with $q_0$. This is implementable using standard gates.\n","\n","The `mask_f` variable flips the result at random, such that we equally get cases in which the constant values can be 0 or 1, likewise for the balanced case"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"tVn6PSij1C2k"},"outputs":[],"source":["from qiskit import QuantumCircuit\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","def get_oracle(is_balanced):\n","    oracle = QuantumCircuit(2)\n","    # EXERCISE: build the oracle!\n","\n","    # whether we flip the function (for completeness)\n","    # so whether f(0) = 1 or 0 independant of balance\n","    # we do this to make sure every case is accessed\n","    mask_f = bool(np.random.randint(0,2))\n","    if mask_f:\n","        oracle.x(1)\n","    return oracle\n","\n","\n","def get_deutsch_josza_circuit(oracle:QuantumCircuit)->QuantumCircuit:\n","    circuit = QuantumCircuit(oracle.num_qubits)\n","    # qubit 0 is the input\n","    circuit.h(0)\n","    circuit.x(1)\n","    circuit.h(1)\n","    # barrier is a cosmetic element\n","    circuit.barrier()\n","    circuit.compose(oracle,inplace=True)\n","    circuit.barrier()\n","    circuit.h(0)\n","    return circuit\n","\n","# whether the function is balanced\n","# if no argument is given, pick random\n","is_balanced = bool(np.random.randint(0,2))\n","\n","oracle = get_oracle(is_balanced)\n","circuit=get_deutsch_josza_circuit(oracle)\n","circuit.draw(\"mpl\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mXy3z_OPnzvW"},"source":["## Measuring\n","\n","Let's try this simple example out.
