Unlike classical circuits, quantum circuits have probabilistic outcomes: if I measure the qubits, I get a string of bits (like $|0111011011\\rangle$, for example), often called a bitstring (guess why), which is only one out of many possible realizations. Therefore, one needs to _sample_ a circuit many times, in order to reconstruct either the wavefunction (you usually try to avoid that, because it is not efficient) or to get an expectation value $\\langle \\psi | \\hat{O} | \\psi \\rangle$, where $|\\psi\\rangle$ is the wavefunction at the end of the circuit. Hence, we need to create a function that simulates the quantum evolution of the circuit, and then get samples from that distribution.\n","\n","If I measure the simple circuit defined above, I should only ever get the $|01\\rangle$ state, since we start in the $|00\\rangle$ state, and we apply a bitflip to the first qubit (qiskit has a right-to-left ordering).\n","\n","We use the \"Statevector\" quantum simulator, which simulates the whole quantum state as a vector (hence the name); it is the standard one, although not very efficient. Note that for a technical reason that is not of much importance for now, we are not using the classical bits to measure, but rather directly getting our information from the state vector simulator.\n","\n","We put together the necessary steps to sample the circuit easily:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"1cfypop-VdIv"},"outputs":[],"source":["from qiskit.quantum_info import Statevector\n","\n","# we input a circuit and a number of samples, and obtain a dictionary of outcomes\n","def sample_circuit(circuit: QuantumCircuit,n_shots:int) -> dict:\n","  statevector = Statevector.from_instruction(circuit)\n","  outcomes = statevector.sample_counts(n_shots)\n","  return outcomes\n","\n","\n","# function that print all the outcomes\n","def print_outcomes(outcomes:dict):\n","  for bitstring,counts in outcomes.items():\n","    print(f\"Obtained bitstring |{bitstring}> {counts} times.\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Sh0sqTuKVxpJ"},"source":["Back to our circuit.\n","\n","Let's call the `sample_circuit` function we defined before."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"xDpLu6uLROD3"},"outputs":[],"source":["# we sample the circuit a 100 times, and see what the outcomes are\n","\n","n_shots = 100\n","outcomes = sample_circuit(circuit,n_shots)\n","print_outcomes(outcomes)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-QaiGwKLQF9X"},"source":["As expected, we only get the $|01\\rangle$ bitstring.\n","\n","Let's move on to more complex circuits.
